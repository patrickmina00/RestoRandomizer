# RestoRandomizer
Android Hackathon Project

The purpose of the app is to help groups (friends, family, pets) to sort out the biggest question of our lives: 
"Where do we wanna eat?".

The app will randomize the choices of the group and display a single place where the users can decide if they want to go 
and eat there. Currently, the app is still in the process of further improvement. We are polishing up bugs and adding in new features that may help attract users. Also, are still working on the app's design altogether.
